## An interpreter written in Java from scratch for a subset of the BASIC language.  
  
This is a project that I made for a university exam about Java programming language.  
The documentation is written in Italian, sorry... I'm going to translate it as soon as I have some spare time!  
  
By the way, the interpreter can manage some basic constructs in the BASIC language like:
* IF-THEN-ELSE
* FOR loops
* WHILE loops
* variables with automatic types (like javascript)
* two kind of basic types: strings and numbers (implemented as doubles)
* logic and arithmetic expressions
* support for nested control structures
* a PRINT function that prints a variable or the result of an expression (both logical or arithmetical) on screen
* an INPUT function that takes a variable in input (from the user's keyboard)  
  
Of course it's a basic project, but it's something I used to understand some basic principles of programming and compiler's structure.  Hope that will help you as well!
